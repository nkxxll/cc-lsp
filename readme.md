# cc-lsp - Conventional Commit Language Server

`cc-lsp` is a language server designed to assist developers in writing commit messages following the
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. It provides
live feedback, autocompletion, and suggestions for conventional commit types such as `feat`, `fix`,
`chore`, `test`, and more. (Props to the

## Features

  commit format.
- **Autocompletion**: Provides autocompletion for commit types (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `test`,
  etc.).
- **Detailed commit type info**: Offers guidance on what each commit type signifies and when to use
  them.
